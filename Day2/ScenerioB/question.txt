We want to create a new type and one or more subcategories of that type
each time a new data values comes it should belong to one of the subcategories and should never 
be tagged as the general type we created

create a class VEHICLE with the following attributes

id string,
brand string,
type which is either CAR,BIKE or OTHER
price float

parameterize constructor with all the parameters
parameterize constructor without price parameters
a copy constructor to copy the object

CalculateTax whose implementation might change in each child but signature is 
"takes no parameter, return float"

create the following functiionalities
a function to create the 3 objects on the heap
a function to find average price of all objects

Demonstrate all functiionalities in Main.cpp
